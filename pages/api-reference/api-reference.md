### Overview

The IBM Cloud Object Storage implementation of the S3 API supports the most commonly used subset of Amazon S3 API operations. A complete list of supported operations can be found in the [API overview]({{ site.baseurl }}/about-compatibility-api).

{% include note.html content="This reference documentation is being continously improved. If you have technical questions about using the API in your application, please post them on StackOverflow using both `ibm-bluemix` and `object-storage` tags and we will do our best to answer promptly, and then improve this documentation thanks to your feedback." %}

### Common Headers

#### Common Request Headers
The following table describes supported common request headers. COS ignores any common headers not listed below if sent in a request, although some requests may support other headers as defined in this documentation.  More information about creating the authorization header can be found in the ["Authentication"]({{ site.baseurl }}/manage-access#authentication) section

| Header             | Note                               |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Authorization      | **Required** for all requests (AWS Signature Version 4).   |
| Host               | **Required** for all requests.                 |
| x-amz-date         | **Required** for all requests. Can also be specified as `Date`.               |
| x-amz-content-sha256 | **Required** for uploading objects or any request with information in the body. |
| Content-Length     | **Required** for uploading objects, chunked encoding also supported.    |
| Content-MD5        | A 128-bit MD5 hash value of the request body being sent.                  |
| Expect             | `100-continue` waits for the headers to be accepted before sending the body.  |

### Operations on Buckets
{: #operations-on-buckets}

#### Create a new bucket

A `PUT` issued to the endpoint root followed by a string will create a bucket using that string for a name.  Bucket names must be unique, and storage instances are limited to 100 buckets.  Bucket names are required to be DNS-compliant; names must be between 3 and 63 characters long must be made of lowercase letters, numbers, and dashes. Bucket names must begin and end with a lowercase letter or number.  Bucket names resembling IP addresses are not allowed, although dot characters (`.`) are permitted. This operation does not make use of operation specific headers or query parameters.

{% include custom/locations.md %}

##### Syntax

```shell
PUT https://{endpoint}/{bucket-name} # path style
PUT https://{bucket-name}.{endpoint} # virtual host style
```

#### Optional payload elements

If an XML block specifying a `LocationConstraint` is provided it must correspond with a valid provisioning code (e.g. `us-standard`).  If the request payload is left empty, the default provisioning code is used.

```xml
<CreateBucketConfiguration>
  <LocationConstraint>{provisioning-code}</LocationConstraint>
</CreateBucketConfiguration>
```

##### Sample request

This is an example of creating a new bucket called 'images'.

#### List objects in a given bucket

A `GET` request addressed to a bucket returns a list of objects, limited to 1,000 at a time and returned in non-lexographical order. The `StorageClass` value that is returned in the response is a default value as storage class operations are not implemented in COS. This operation does not make use of operation specific headers or payload elements.

##### Syntax

{% include note.html content="Note that the 'version 2' method of listing objects within a bucket is not supported, and the 'version 1' syntax is needed." %}

```bash
GET https://{endpoint}/{bucket-name} # path style
GET https://{bucket-name}.{endpoint} # virtual host style
```

##### Optional query parameters

Name | Type | Description
--- | ---- | ------------
`prefix` | string | Constrains response to object names beginning with `prefix`.
`delimiter` | string | Groups objects between the `prefix` and the `delimiter`.
`encoding-type` | string | If unicode characters that are not supported by XML are used in an object name, this parameter can be set to `url` to properly encode the response.
`max-keys` | string | Restricts the number of objects to display in the response.  Default and maximum is 1,000.
`marker` | string | Specifies the object from where the listing should begin, in UTF-8 binary order.

##### Sample request

This request lists the objects inside the "apiary" bucket.

```http
GET /apiary HTTP/1.1

#### Delete a bucket

A `DELETE` issued to an empty bucket deletes the bucket. After deleting a bucket the name will be held in reserve by the system for 10 minutes, after which it will be released for re-use.  *Only empty buckets can be deleted.* This operation does not make use of operation specific headers, query parameters, or payload elements.

##### Syntax

```bash
DELETE https://{endpoint}/{bucket-name} # path style
DELETE https://{bucket-name}.{endpoint} # virtual host style
```

##### Sample request

```http
DELETE /images HTTP/1.1
Host: s3-api.us-geo.objectstorage.softlayer.net
x-amz-date: 20160822T064812Z
Authorization: {authorization-string}
```

The server responds with `204 No Content`.

If a non-empty bucket is requested for deletion, the server responds with `409 Conflict`.

##### Sample request

```http
DELETE /apiary HTTP/1.1
Authorization: {authorization-string}
x-amz-date: 20160825T174049Z
Host: s3-api.us-geo.objectstorage.softlayer.net
```

##### Sample response

```xml
<Error>
  <Code>BucketNotEmpty</Code>
  <Message>The bucket you tried to delete is not empty.</Message>
  <Resource>/apiary/</Resource>
  <RequestId>9d2bbc00-2827-4210-b40a-8107863f4386</RequestId>
  <httpStatusCode>409</httpStatusCode>
</Error>
```

#### Create an access control list for a bucket

A `PUT` issued to a bucket with the necessary query parameter creates or replaces an access control list (ACL) for that bucket.  Access control lists allow for granting different sets of permissions to different storage accounts using the account's ID, or by using a pre-made ACL.

{% include important.html content="Credentials are generated for each storage account, not for individual users.  As such, ACLs do not have the ability to restrict or grant access to a given user, only to a storage account. However, `public-read-write` allows any other COS storage account to access the resource, as well as the general public. " %}

ACLs can use pre-made permissions sets (or 'canned ACLs') or be customized in the body of the request. Pre-made ACLs are specified using the `x-amz-acl` header and custom ACLs are specified using XML in the request payload. Only one method (header or payload) can be used in a single request.

This operation does not make use of additional operation specific query parameters.

ACL grantees must be other COS storage instances, and their UUID can be found along with credentials in the web portal.


The assigned permissions behave as follows:

| Permission | When granted on a bucket | When granted on an object |
|------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| READ | Allows grantee to list and read all objects in bucket | Allows grantee to read object data and metadata |
| WRITE | Allows grantee to create, overwrite and delete any object in bucket. Cannot be granted independently from READ permission. | N/A |
| READ_ACP | This permission does not exist for buckets; default setting is FULL_CONTROL | Allows grantee to read object ACL |
| WRITE_ACP | Default setting is FULL_CONTROL | Allows grantee to write ACL for applicable object |
| FULL_CONTROL | Allows grantee READ, WRITE, READ_ACP and WRITE_ACP permissions on bucket | Allows grantee READ, READ_ACP and WRITE_ACP permissions on object |

**Note:** The ``READ_ACP``, ``WRITE_ACP``, and ``FULL_CONTROL`` permissions are implied by the bucket “own” permission. When any of these permissions are assigned to a grantee in a bucket ACL, that grantee will be granted the bucket “own” permission.

The following canned ACLs are supported by IBM COS.  Values not listed below are not supported.

| Canned ACL | Applies to | Notes |
|------------|------------|-----------|
| private | Bucket and object | When set on a bucket, the requestor is interpreted as the bucket owner. |
| public-read | Bucket and object | When set on a bucket, the requestor is interpreted as the bucket owner. |
| public-read-write | Bucket and object | When set on a bucket, the requestor is interpreted as the bucket owner. |
| authenticated-read  | Bucket and object | Supported when set on an object only. Not supported as a bucket ACL. |

{% include note.html content="`READ` access, including `public-read`, when granted on a bucket does not allow for the actual access of objects themselves, only the ability to list them." %}

##### Syntax

```bash
PUT https://{endpoint}/{bucket-name}?acl= # path style
PUT https://{bucket-name}.{endpoint}?acl= # virtual host style
```

##### Sample request Basic pre-made ACL

This is an example of specifying a pre-made ACL to allow for `public-read` access to the "apiary" bucket. This allows any storage account to view the bucket's contents and ACL details.

```http
PUT /apiary?acl= HTTP/1.1
Authorization: {authorization-string}
x-amz-date: 20161011T190354Z
x-amz-acl: public-read
Host: s3-api.us-geo.objectstorage.softlayer.net
```

```

##### Sample request Custom ACL

This is an example of specifying a custom ACL to allow for another user using their username to view the ACL for the "apiary" bucket, but not to list objects stored inside the bucket. A third account is given full access to the same bucket as another element of the same ACL.  All authenticated users of the system can list objects in the bucket.

```http
PUT /apiary?acl= HTTP/1.1
Authorization: {authorization-string}
x-amz-date: 20161011T190354Z
Host: s3-api.us-geo.objectstorage.softlayer.net

### Operations on Objects
{: #operations-on-objects}

#### Upload an object

A `PUT` given a path to an object uploads the request body as an object. A SHA256 hash of the object is a required header.  All objects are limited to 5TB in size. This operation does not make use of operation specific query parameters, or payload elements.

###### Syntax

```bash
PUT https://{endpoint}/{bucket-name}/{object-name} # path style
PUT https://{bucket-name}.{endpoint}/{object-name} # virtual host style
```

##### Specific headers for SSE-C

The following headers are available for buckets using Server Side Encryption with Customer-Provided Keys (SSE-C). Any request using SSE-C headers must be sent using SSL. Note that `ETag` values in response headers are *not* the MD5 hash of the object, but a randomly generated 32-byte hexadecimal string.

Header | Type | Description
--- | ---- | ------------
`x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm` | string | This header is used to specify the algorithm and key size to use with the encryption key stored in `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key` header. This value must be set to the string `AES256`.
`x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key` | string | This header is used to transport the base 64 encoded byte string representation of the AES 256 key used in the server side encryption process.
`x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5` | string | This header is used to transport the base64-encoded 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according to RFC 1321. The object store will use this value to validate the key passes in the `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key` has not been corrupted during transport and encoding process. The digest must be calculated on the key BEFORE the key is base 64 encoded.

###### Sample request

 Female bees that are not fortunate enough to be selected to be the 'queen'
 while they were still larvae become known as 'worker' bees. These bees lack
 the ability to reproduce and instead ensure that the hive functions smoothly,
 acting almost as a single organism in fulfilling their purpose.

#### Copy an object

A `PUT` given a path to a new object creates a new copy of another object specified by the `x-amz-copy-source` header. Unless otherwise altered the metadata remains the same, although any ACL is reset to `private` for the  account creating the copy. This operation does not make use of operation specific query parameters or payload elements.


###### Syntax

```bash
PUT https://{endpoint}/{bucket-name}/{object-name} # path style
PUT https://{bucket-name}.{endpoint}/{object-name} # virtual host style
```

#### Optional headers

Header | Type | Description
--- | ---- | ------------
`x-amz-metadata-directive` | string (`COPY` or `REPLACE`) | `REPLACE` will overwrite original metadata with new metadata that is provided.
`x-amz-copy-source-if-match` | string (`ETag`)| Creates a copy if the specified `ETag` matches the source object.
`x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match` | string (`ETag`)| Creates a copy if the specified `ETag` is different from the source object.
`x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since` | string (timestamp)| Creates a copy if the the source object has not been modified since the specified date.  Date must be a valid HTTP date (e.g. `Wed, 30 Nov 2016 20:21:38 GMT`).
`x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since` | string (timestamp)| Creates a copy if the source object has been modified since the specified date.  Date must be a valid HTTP date (e.g. `Wed, 30 Nov 2016 20:21:38 GMT`).

#### Specific headers for SSE-C

The following headers are available for objects being copied into buckets that have Server Side Encryption with Customer-Provided Keys (SSE-C). Any `PUT` request using SSE-C headers must be sent using SSL. Note that `ETag` values in response headers are *not* the MD5 hash of the object, but a randomly generated 32-byte hexadecimal string.

The specific SSE-C headers used to initially upload objects are required if the copy operation will encrypt the copy of the data at the target destination. If the original/source object was encrypted using SSE-C, the spefic headers used for copying objects will need to be present to decrypt the object source. Copies of objects do not need to be encrypted with the same key.

Header | Type | Description
--- | ---- | ------------
`x-amz-copy-source-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm` | string | This header is used to specify the algorithm and key size to use with the encryption key stored in `x-amz-copy-source-server-side-encryption-customer-key` header. This value must be set to the string `AES256`.
`x-amz-copy-source-server-side-encryption-customer-key` | string | This header is used to transport the base 64 encoded byte string representation of the AES 256 key used in the server side encryption process.
`x-amz-copy-source-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5` | string | This header is used to transport the base64-encoded 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according to RFC 1321.

#### Create an ACL for an object

A `PUT` issued to an object with the proper parameters creates an access control list (ACL) for that object.  Access control lists allow for granting different sets of permissions to different storage accounts using the account's ID, or by using a pre-made ACL.

{% include important.html content="Credentials are generated for each storage account, not for individual users.  As such, ACLs do not have the ability to restrict or grant access to a given user, only to a storage account. However, `public-read-write` allows any other CRS storage account to access the resource, as well as the general public. " %}

The assigned permissions behave as follows:

| Permission | When granted on a bucket | When granted on an object |
|------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| READ | Allows grantee to list and read all objects in bucket | Allows grantee to read object data and metadata |
| WRITE | Allows grantee to create, overwrite and delete any object in bucket. Cannot be granted independently from READ permission. | N/A |
| READ_ACP | This permission does not exist for buckets; default setting is FULL_CONTROL | Allows grantee to read object ACL |
| WRITE_ACP | Default setting is FULL_CONTROL | Allows grantee to write ACL for applicable object |
| FULL_CONTROL | Allows grantee READ, WRITE, READ_ACP and WRITE_ACP permissions on bucket | Allows grantee READ, READ_ACP and WRITE_ACP permissions on object |


The following canned ACLs are supported by IBM COS.  Values not listed below are not supported.

| Canned ACL | Applies to | Notes |
|------------|------------|-----------|
| private | Bucket and object | When set on a bucket, the requestor is interpreted as the bucket owner. |
| public-read | Bucket and object | When set on a bucket, the requestor is interpreted as the bucket owner. |
| public-read-write | Bucket and object | When set on a bucket, the requestor is interpreted as the bucket owner. |

{% include note.html content="It is not possible to grant granular `WRITE` access at the object level, only at the bucket level." %}

###### Syntax

```bash
PUT https://{endpoint}/{bucket-name}/{object-name}?acl= # path style
PUT https://{bucket-name}.{endpoint}/{object-name}?acl= # virtual host style

#### Uploading objects in multiple parts

When working with larger objects, multipart upload operations are recommended to write objects into IBM COS. An upload of a single object can be performed as a set of parts and these parts can be uploaded independently in any order and in parallel. Upon upload completion, IBM COS then presents all parts as a single object. This provides many benefits: network interruptions do not cause large uploads to fail, uploads can be paused and restarted over time, and objects can be uploaded as they are being created.

Multipart uploads are only available for objects larger than 5MB. For objects smaller than 50GB, 500 parts sized 20MB to 100MB is recommended for optimum performance. For larger objects, part size can be increased without significant performance impact.  Multipart uploads are limited to no more than 10,000 parts of 5GB each and a maximum object size of 5TB.

Due to the additional complexity involved, it is recommended that developers make use of S3 API libraries that provide multipart upload support.

Incomplete multipart uploads do persist until the object is deleted or the multipart upload is aborted with `AbortIncompleteMultipartUpload`. If an incomplete multipart upload is not aborted, the partial upload continues to use resources.  Interfaces should be designed with this point in mind, and clean up incomplete multipart uploads.

There are three phases to uploading an object in multiple parts:

1. The upload is initiated and an `UploadId` is created.
2. Individual parts are uploaded specifying their sequential part numbers and the `UploadId` for the object.
3. When all parts are finished uploading, the upload is completed by sending a request with the `UploadId` and an XML block that lists each part number and it's respective `Etag` value.

#### Initiate a multipart upload

A `POST` issued to an object with the query parameter `upload` creates a new `UploadId` value, which is then be referenced by each part of the object being uploaded.

###### Syntax

```bash
POST https://{endpoint}/{bucket-name}/{object-name}?uploads= # path style
POST https://{bucket-name}.{endpoint}/{object-name}?uploads= # virtual host style
```

#### Specific headers for SSE-C

The following headers are available for buckets using Server Side Encryption with Customer-Provided Keys (SSE-C). Any request using SSE-C headers must be sent using SSL. Note that `ETag` values in response headers are *not* the MD5 hash of the object, but a randomly generated 32-byte hexadecimal string. *These headers must be identical to those provided for each part of the multipart upload.*

Header | Type | Description
--- | ---- | ------------
`x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm` | string | This header is used to specify the algorithm and key size to use with the encryption key stored in `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key` header. This value must be set to the string `AES256`.
`x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key` | string | This header is used to transport the base 64 encoded byte string representation of the AES 256 key used in the server side encryption process.
`x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5` | string | This header is used to transport the base64-encoded 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according to RFC 1321. The object store will use this value to validate the key passes in the `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key` has not been corrupted during transport and encoding process. The digest must be calculated on the key BEFORE the key is base 64 encoded.

#### Upload a part

A `PUT` request issued to an object with query parameters `partNumber` and `uploadId` will upload one part of an object.  The parts may be uploaded serially or in parallel, but must be numbered in order.

###### Syntax

```bash
PUT https://{endpoint}/{bucket-name}/{object-name}?partNumber={sequential-integer}&uploadId={uploadId}= # path style
PUT https://{bucket-name}.{endpoint}/{object-name}?partNumber={sequential-integer}&uploadId={uploadId}= # virtual host style
```


#### Specific headers for SSE-C

The following headers are available for buckets using Server Side Encryption with Customer-Provided Keys (SSE-C). Any request using SSE-C headers must be sent using SSL. Note that `ETag` values in response headers are *not* the MD5 hash of the object, but a randomly generated 32-byte hexadecimal string. *These headers must be identical to those provided when the multipart operation was initiated.*

Header | Type | Description
--- | ---- | ------------
`x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm` | string | This header is used to specify the algorithm and key size to use with the encryption key stored in `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key` header. This value must be set to the string `AES256`.
`x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key` | string | This header is used to transport the base 64 encoded byte string representation of the AES 256 key used in the server side encryption process.
`x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5` | string | This header is used to transport the base64-encoded 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according to RFC 1321. The object store will use this value to validate the key passes in the `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key` has not been corrupted during transport and encoding process. The digest must be calculated on the key BEFORE the key is base 64 encoded.

#### Complete a multipart upload

A `POST` request issued to an object with query parameter `uploadId` and the appropriate XML block in the body will complete a multipart upload.

###### Syntax

```bash
POST https://{endpoint}/{bucket-name}/{object-name}?uploadId={uploadId}= # path style
POST https://{bucket-name}.{endpoint}/{object-name}?uploadId={uploadId}= # virtual host style
```

```xml
<CompleteMultipartUpload>
  <Part>
    <PartNumber>{sequential part number}</PartNumber>
    <ETag>{ETag value from part upload response header}</ETag>
  </Part>
</CompleteMultipartUpload>
```

#### Abort incomplete multipart uploads

A `DELETE` request issued to an object with query parameter `uploadId` will delete all unfinished parts of a multipart upload.

###### Syntax

```bash
DELETE https://{endpoint}/{bucket-name}/{object-name}?uploadId={uploadId}= # path style
DELETE https://{bucket-name}.{endpoint}/{object-name}?uploadId={uploadId}= # virtual host style
